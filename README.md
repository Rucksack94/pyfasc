# Python Performance Factor for Scientific Computing

ðŸ“œ _This project investigates different implementations in Python, C++ and other hybrid approaches of some Scientific Computing applications,
in order to estimate the typical performance factor induced by Python._

## Current codes

- [01_advDiffSolver](./codes/01_advDiffSolver) : C++ and Python-Numpy based implementation of a 2D linear advection diffusion solver.
